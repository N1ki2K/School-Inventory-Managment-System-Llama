# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This repository contains a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the School Inventory Management System built with GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Pipeline Overview

### Workflows

1. **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Lint and type checking
   - Testing with Playwright
   - Building the application
   - Security auditing
   - Docker image building and pushing
   - Deployment to staging/production

2. **Dependency Management** (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Security scanning with CodeQL
   - Weekly dependency audits

3. **Release Management** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - Automated releases on version tags
   - Docker image publishing
   - Release asset management

4. **Preview Deployments** (`.github/workflows/preview.yml`)
   - Automatic preview deployments for PRs
   - Cleanup on PR closure

5. **Performance Testing** (`.github/workflows/performance.yml`)
   - Lighthouse performance testing
   - Bundle analysis
   - Load testing with k6

6. **Infrastructure Management** (`.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml`)
   - Terraform infrastructure management
   - Database migrations
   - Environment provisioning

7. **Monitoring & Alerting** (`.github/workflows/monitoring.yml`)
   - Health checks
   - Metrics collection
   - Alert notifications

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Docker Hub
DOCKER_USERNAME=your-docker-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your-docker-password

# Database
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_PORT=your-database-port
DB_USERNAME=your-database-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password

# Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK=your-slack-webhook-url
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
ALERT_EMAIL=alerts@domain.com

# Deployment (optional)
VERCEL_TOKEN=your-vercel-token
NETLIFY_TOKEN=your-netlify-token
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create the following environments in your GitHub repository:

- **staging**: For staging deployments
- **production**: For production deployments

### 3. Branch Protection Rules

Set up branch protection rules for `main` and `develop` branches:

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require linear history

## üìã Workflow Triggers

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Push** to `main` or `develop` branches
- **Pull Request** to `main` or `develop` branches

### Dependency Management
- **Schedule**: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch

### Release Management
- **Push** tags starting with `v*`
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch with version input

### Preview Deployments
- **Pull Request** opened, synchronized, or reopened
- **Pull Request** closed (cleanup)

### Performance Testing
- **Push** to `main` branch
- **Pull Request** to `main` branch
- **Schedule**: Daily at 2 AM UTC

### Infrastructure Management
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch with action and environment inputs

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Schedule**: Every 5 minutes
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch

## üéØ Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- ESLint passes with no errors
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Prettier formatting is correct
- Security audit passes

### Testing
- All Playwright tests pass
- Test coverage meets requirements
- Performance tests pass Lighthouse thresholds

### Security
- No high or critical vulnerabilities
- CodeQL analysis passes
- Dependencies are up to date

### Performance
- Lighthouse performance score ‚â• 80
- Bundle size within limits
- Load testing passes

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment
- Automatic deployment on `develop` branch
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Health checks and monitoring

### Production Environment
- Manual deployment approval required
- Automatic deployment on `main` branch
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Rollback capabilities

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks
- Application health endpoints
- Database connectivity
- External service dependencies

### Metrics Collection
- Application performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Error rates and response times

### Alerting
- Slack notifications for failures
- Email alerts for critical issues
- Uptime monitoring

## üîÑ Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback
- Failed health checks trigger automatic rollback
- Performance degradation detection
- Error rate threshold breaches

### Manual Rollback
- One-click rollback via GitHub Actions
- Database migration rollback
- Infrastructure rollback with Terraform

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization
- Parallel job execution
- Caching strategies
- Incremental builds

### Deployment Optimization
- Docker layer caching
- CDN integration
- Resource optimization

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
- Encrypted secrets storage
- Least privilege access
- Regular secret rotation

### Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Container security scanning

### Compliance
- Security policy enforcement
- Audit trail maintenance
- Compliance reporting
